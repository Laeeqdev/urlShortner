A "file text" refers to a text file, which is a computer file containing plain text characters without special formatting like bold, italics, or images. Text files are used to store and share textual data like source code, emails, log files, and configuration data, and they are widely compatible and easy to create and edit with simple text editors like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).
